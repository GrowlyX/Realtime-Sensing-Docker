* Setup

** Build
Run the ~./rebuild.sh~ as root.

** Run
Run the command ~docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -p realtime-sensing up~. You may need to run this as root.

** Setting up the database, backend, and frontend

*** MongoDB (database)
Requires no further configuration.

*** Node-Red (backend)
To get node-red to work, you simply have to enter the credentials for the mongo database.

Add your MQTT credentials to the "MQTT" node.

For the mongo nodes, there are two users: ~mqtt~, which has read-write access, and ~web~, which only has read access. The ~mqtt~ user should be entered to the first mongo node ("sensors@mongo (user mqtt)")--default password is mqttpassword.

The ~web~ user should be added to all others. To do this, on the first node you configure for web, click "add new mongodb." Enter ~mongo~ for the hostname. The default ~web~ user password is webpassword. Then, for subsequent web nodes, click on the mongodb credential you just created.
